clone the repository in your local system
you can either create project and then push that on this repo or just can simply add files and push here for future refernces
git add . (. here represents all changed files)
git commit -m "commit message"
git push origin master
while pushing the code on remote and in master branch it will ask for user name and password, you need to give your account username and password here for which i have added the access
master would be our main branch
moving on we will cut a new branch and then push code in new branch and then merge that new branch into master
this is how standard process goes
so that master branch remain stable
and new branch is merged after complete testing of code
